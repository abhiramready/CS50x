# 1. Computer Science
**Computer Science** is about the goal of **problem solving** using **computational thinking**

Thinking like a computer and apply solutions to problems i.e which is computational, cleanup thought process, logical and methodical

## Representing Numbers

### Binary
- Comptuers use base-2 or binary usings 0's and 1's
- Because Binary maps readily with electronics like 'on' (1) and 'off' (0) or store electrical charge using transistors, modern devices like laptops and mobiles have millions and billions of them. Apples M3 pro has 37 billion.
- Bit comes from the _**Bi**_ nary digi _**t**_
- Humans use base 10 for e.g. 123 (read as one hundred twenty three) = 1 x 100 + 2 x 20 + 3 x 1 (hundreds, tens and ones place)
- In base-2/binary the number 7 = 111 i.e (1 x 2^2 = 4) + (1 x 2^1 = 2) + (1 x 2^0 = 1)
- If we want 8 we add one more bit 8 = 1000 i.e (1 x 2^3 = 8) + (0 x 2^2 = 0) + (0 x 2^1 = 0) + (0 x 2^0 = 0)
