## Computer Science
**Computer Science** is about the goal of **problem solving** using **computational thinking**

Thinking like a computer and applying solutions to problems i.e in a computational way, clean thought process, logical and methodical

## How Data is represented
### Binary
- Humans use base 10 e.g. 123 (read as one hundred twenty-three) = 1 x 100 + 2 x 20 + 3 x 1 (hundreds, tens, and ones place)
- Computers use base-2 or binary using 0's and 1's, Bit comes from the _**Bi**_ nary digi _**t**_
- Binary maps readily with electronics like 'on' (1) and 'off' (0) or store electrical charge using transistors, modern devices like laptops and mobiles have millions and billions of them. Apple M3 Pro has 37 billion
- In base-2/binary the number 7 = 111 i.e (1 x 2^2 = 4) + (1 x 2^1 = 2) + (1 x 2^0 = 1)
- If we want 8 we add one more bit 8 = 1000 i.e (1 x 2^3 = 8) + (0 x 2^2 = 0) + (0 x 2^1 = 0) + (0 x 2^0 = 0)
- Data is stored in **bytes**, 1 byte = 9 bits, let's take 1 byte with all 1's 11111111 = 255 and hold up to 256 numbers if we consider 0

### ASCII
- ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- Ultimately all devices read or understand only bits so we made ASCII (a standard data-encoding format for electronic communication between computers)
- **A** in ASCII is 65 in binary it's 01000001, Hi! is 72 73 33

### Unicode
- Unicode is an encoding standard that uses up to 32 bits, as required to capture all known languages and characters
- Unicode uses two encoding forms: 8-bit and 16-bit depending on the data being encoded
- Emojis contain the color and combination of emojis is the result of combining the Unicode characters of various emojis, although emojis might look a bit different on Android, Apple, etc the underlying Unicode is the same
- Context matters: We follow various methods to present information in different forms like text, emoji, and colors for example, each pixel can be 8 bits to represent the combination of RGB,  pixels come together to form an picture or an emoji, music is made up of notes and loudness, video is moving images and so on
